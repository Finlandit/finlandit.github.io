# r/Finland Public Moderator Tools

Everything shown on the page is 100% public information, gotten from our r/Finland Wiki or other public Reddit APIs.

## What is this?

It's a website for monitoring community moderator ("*decentralized moderating*") activity. Since we've given you the control to moderate, you should also have access to some tools to monitor your fellow moderators.


## What does it try to achieve?

1. See how decentralized moderating performs. 
2. Notice command abuse early on and possibly revoke that community member's permissions before too much damage could be done. 
3. Motivate users to moderate, knowing their efforts will not go unnoticed.

## Miscellaneous

Suggestions and contributions are welcome, just make an issue beforehand so that we can discuss it.
