# Decentralized Moderator Tools

This site is for monitoring community moderator ("*decentralized moderating*") activity. Since we've given you the control to moderate, you should also have access to some tools to monitor your fellow moderators. Everything shown on the page is 100% public information, gotten from our r/Finland Wiki or other public Reddit APIs.

## Why?

1. See how decentralized moderating performs. 
2. Notice command abuse early on and possibly revoke that community member's permissions before too much damage could be done. 
3. Motivate users to moderate, knowing their efforts will not go unnoticed.
